 4. Trends, Patterns & Anomalies
Trends: Electronics has high-value purchases.

Patterns: Younger users prefer UPI; older prefer Credit Card.

Anomalies: CustomerID 1007 made a ₹0 purchase (suspicious).

 5. Hypotheses & Stats
H1: Men and women spend differently. → Use groupby('Gender')

H2: Average spend increases with age. → Use corr(Age, PurchaseAmount)

H3: Electronics = highest average purchase. → Use groupby('ProductCategory')

⚠️ 6. Data Quality Issues
Zero value in PurchaseAmount (likely error or return).

Small sample size → not generalizable.

No missing values in this case, but needs checking in real data.
